Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are the ones I use for Mac and Linux

Frequent use:

- fish: friendly interactive shell
- vimrc: manage plugins with VimPlug
- ranger: vim-inspired terminal-based file-browser
- kitty: GPU accelerated terminal

some use:

- gitignore: global system git ignore
- ag ignore: ag is nicer than grep to search words 
- flake8: python linter
- pylintrc: python linter more strict

rare use:

- zathura: pdf reader
- qutebrowser: browser
- newsboat: rss feed reader
- i3gaps: tiling windows manager for linux. I use dwm in linux and amethist in MacOs
- vifm: vim-inspired terminal-based file-browser
- tmux: terminal multiplexer
- sxhkd: change keyboard keys
- mpv: video
- bashrc: bash terminal
- zsh: z-shell terminal
- xonshrc: python-based terminal
